# Positive Charges in an Electric Field

### **KEY CONCEPTS** (From Lesson)

#### Electric Force on a Charge in an Electric Field:
> **F = qE**
>
> Where:
> - **F** = Electric force on the charge (N)
> - **q** = Charge magnitude (C)
> - **E** = Electric field strength (N/C or V/m)

#### Direction Rules:
- **For positive charges (+q):** Force direction is **same** as E field direction
- **E field lines:** Directed **away from positive charges** and **toward negative charges**

---

## 📌 **MAIN QUESTION:**
**How do positive charges behave when under the influence of an E field?**

---

### **SCENARIO 1: Charge Enters Parallel ALONG the E Field**
*(Velocity is in the same direction as E field)*

```
E field direction →

+q ●→ v (velocity)
    ←→→→→→→→→→→→→→→→→
    E field lines
```

**Behavior:**
- The **positive charge accelerates** in the direction of motion
- Force F = qE acts in the **same direction** as velocity
- The charge **speeds up** (gains kinetic energy)
- Motion is **straight-line**, no deflection

**Physics Explanation:**
Since F = qE and the charge is positive, the force points in the same direction as E. When velocity and force are parallel, the particle accelerates along its path.

---

### **SCENARIO 2: Charge Enters Parallel AGAINST the E Field**
*(Velocity is opposite to the E field direction)*

```
E field direction →

           v ←● +q (velocity opposite to E)
    ←→→→→→→→→→→→→→→→→
    E field lines
```

**Behavior:**
- The **positive charge decelerates** (slows down)
- Force F = qE acts **opposite** to the direction of motion
- The charge **loses kinetic energy**
- Motion remains **straight-line**, no deflection
- May eventually **stop and reverse direction** if field is strong enough

**Physics Explanation:**
The force still points in the direction of E (forward), but since the particle moves backward (against E), the force opposes motion, causing deceleration.

---

### **SCENARIO 3: Charge Enters PERPENDICULAR to the E Field**
*(Velocity is at 90° to the E field direction)*

```
    E field direction ↓
    ↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓

+q ●→ v (velocity horizontal)

    ↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓
```

**Behavior:**
- The charge follows a **parabolic (curved) path**
- Force F = qE acts **perpendicular** to the initial velocity
- Horizontal velocity component remains **constant**
- Vertical velocity component **increases** in direction of E
- Motion is similar to **projectile motion** in gravity

**Physics Explanation:**
This is analogous to throwing a ball horizontally in Earth's gravitational field. The constant perpendicular force causes the particle to curve toward the direction of the electric field.

## 📌 **FOLLOW-UP QUESTION:**
**How would the orientation and intensity of the field affect a charge released at the field?**

### **Answer Based on Lesson:**

#### Effect of ORIENTATION:
- **E field direction determines force direction** on the positive charge
- If released (initially at rest), the positive charge will **accelerate in the direction of E**
- The path of the charge depends on its initial velocity relative to E

#### Effect of INTENSITY (Field Strength):
From the lesson: **|E| = k q₂/r²**

- **Stronger E field** → **Greater force** (F = qE)
- Greater force → **Greater acceleration** (a = F/m)
- Result: **Faster motion** and **more pronounced deflection**

> *"The farther the separation in the [charge sources], the greater the effect"* (from lesson on field strength)

## 🎯 **SUMMARY BULLET POINTS FOR SLIDE:**

✅ **Positive charges experience force in the SAME direction as E field** (F = qE)

✅ **Parallel along E field:** Charge **accelerates** (speeds up)

✅ **Parallel against E field:** Charge **decelerates** (slows down, may reverse)

✅ **Perpendicular to E field:** Charge follows **parabolic/curved path**

✅ **Field intensity affects magnitude:** Stronger E → Greater force → Faster motion

✅ **Field orientation affects direction:** E direction = Force direction on +q
