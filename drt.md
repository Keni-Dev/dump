Perfect! Here’s the updated version with **NLT (New Living Translation)** for the verses:

-----

## **EXTENDED SMALL GROUP DISCUSSION FLOW**

### **1) WARM-UP QUESTIONS** (7-10 mins)

*Set the vibe. Make it comfortable. Let them open up naturally.*

**Start light:**

- “Alright guys, before anything else—on a scale of 1-10, gaano kayo ka-excited for this new sem?” *(Let them answer. React sa sagot nila. Kung may negative, acknowledge it.)*
- “Okay real talk, sino dito yung feeling niya mas brutal yung Math subjects natin this sem compared last sem?” *(Relate sa isa’t isa. Laugh about it. Maybe share kung anong subject yung pinakakinatakutan niyo.)*

**Go a bit deeper:**

- “Alright, one more. Seryoso na ‘to. Ano yung ONE thing na you’re lowkey worried about this semester? Pwedeng acads, spiritual, personal, relationships—kahit ano. Walang judgment dito.”
  
  *(Give them space. Yung tipong hindi ka mag-rush. Let each person share kung gusto nila. If may mahiyain, okay lang. Pero create yung atmosphere na safe yung space.)*

**Transition:**

- “Thanks guys for being real. Yun yung gusto ko—na transparent tayo sa isa’t isa. Kasi di ba, part ng reason bakit tayo nandito ngayon ay to remind ourselves na **hindi tayo mag-isa sa season na ’to.** And that’s actually exactly what I want us to talk about today.”

-----

### **2) THE WORD/VERSE**

**Optional intro before reading:**
“Guys, I want us to read this verse together. This is from Ecclesiastes 4, and it’s one of those passages na sobrang simple pero sobrang powerful. Ready? Let me read it.”

*(Read the verse slowly. Let it sink in.)*

**Ecclesiastes 4:9-12 (NLT)**

> *“Two people are better off than one, for they can help each other succeed. If one person falls, the other can reach out and help. But someone who falls alone is in real trouble. Likewise, two people lying close together can keep each other warm. But how can one be warm alone? A person standing alone can be attacked and defeated, but two can stand back-to-back and conquer. Three are even better, for a triple-braided cord is not easily broken.”*


-----

### **3) POINTS ABOUT THE WORD** (Keep it conversational but deeper)

**Opening:**
“So guys, alam niyo yung feeling na parang sobrang hirap ng buhay, parang you’re carrying everything on your own? Yung parang walang makakaintindi, walang pwedeng lapitan, kasi busy din sila sa sarili nilang struggles? Yan yung sinasalungat ng verse na ‘to. Yung message is clear: **we’re not meant to do life alone.**

And yan yung perfect timing para sa atin ngayong start ng sem—kasi alam nating lahat, this is going to be HARD. But we’re not going through it solo. We’re doing it together.”

-----

#### **POINT 1: “Two people are better off than one, for they can help each other succeed”**

**“Let’s start with the first line: ‘Two people are better off than one, for they can help each other succeed.’”**

“Guys, alam nating lahat—BS Math is NO JOKE. Yung subjects natin ngayong second sem? Next level. Advanced Calculus, Linear Algebra, Differential Equations—lahat yan parang boss battles sa video game. And to be honest, kung solo mode ka, grabe yung struggle. Pero may difference pag may kasama ka.

Think about it: **When you’re stuck sa isang problem na 2 hours mo nang iniisip, tapos may isa dito na mag-eexplain sayo ng alternative solution, biglang naging clear.** When you feel like giving up kasi you failed another quiz, may isa dito na mag-tetext sayo ng ‘bro, tara coffee, kaya natin ‘to.’ **When you’re burned out and questioning if you’re even cut out for this course, may isa dito na mag-rremind sayo kung bakit ka nag-Math in the first place.**

Two people are better off than one. **Hindi ibig sabihin nun na perfect na tayo pag magkasama—ibig sabihin nun ay mas equipped tayo to handle whatever this sem throws at us.**”

*(Pause. Let that sink in.)*

-----

#### **POINT 2: “If one person falls, the other can reach out and help. But someone who falls alone is in real trouble”**

**“Now yung second part: ‘If one person falls, the other can reach out and help. But someone who falls alone is in real trouble.’”**

“Guys, malinaw yung message dito. **This semester, we WILL fall.** Hindi ‘what if,’ pero ‘when.’ May moment na babagsak grades mo. May moment na ma-ooverwhelm ka. May moment na mawawala motivation mo. May moment na mafe-feel mo na spiritually dry ka, parang di mo na nararamdaman yung presence ni Lord.

And you know what? **That’s okay.** Falling is part of the journey. Pero yung tragedy is yung taong bumabagsak na walang tumutulong. Yung taong nag-sstuggle in silence kasi ayaw nyang maging pabigat. Yung taong feeling niya kailangan niyang mag-pretend na okay siya kahit hindi na talaga.

**Yan yung ayaw natin mangyari sa isa’t isa.** This group? This friendship? **We’re a safety net for each other.** Pag may bumagsak, we catch them. Pag may sumusuko, we pull them back up. Pag may nawawala, we find them.

**And guys, importante rin ‘to: wag kayong matakot magsabi na you’re not okay.** Pride kills community. Vulnerability builds it. So pag nahihirapan ka, **sabihin mo. Pag struggling ka spiritually, sabihin mo. Pag kailangan mo ng prayer, ng accountability, ng someone to just listen—sabihin mo.** Kasi nandito kami. Andito tayo para sa isa’t isa.”

*(Pause again. Look at them. Make it personal.)*

-----

#### **POINT 3: “A triple-braided cord is not easily broken”**

**“And finally, yung pinaka-crucial part: ‘A person standing alone can be attacked and defeated, but two can stand back-to-back and conquer. Three are even better, for a triple-braided cord is not easily broken.’”**

“Guys, alam niyo yung rope? Pag one strand lang, madaling putulin. Pag two strands, mas matibay. Pero pag three strands, braided together? **Almost impossible to break.**

So sino yung third strand? **That’s Christ.**

**We’re not just a barkada na nag-aaral together. We’re not just classmates na magkakasama lang dahil same course tayo. We’re brothers and sisters in Christ, and THAT is what makes us different.** Yung foundation natin is not just friendship—it’s faith. Our bond is rooted in something eternal. **And because of that, we’re stronger than we think.**

With Christ in the middle, hindi tayo basta magkasama lang—**we’re united by the same purpose, the same hope, the same Savior.** And yan yung reason kung bakit kahit gaano kahirap yung darating na months, **we won’t break.** Hindi dahil perfect tayo. Hindi dahil malakas tayo. Pero dahil **hindi tayo nag-iisa—we have each other, AND we have Him.**”

-----

#### **BONUS REFLECTION: A story/metaphor**

**“Guys, you know what’s interesting? We’re here sa DRT—surrounded by nature. Tignan niyo yung mga trees around us. Yung isang tree, kahit gaano pa kalakas yung trunk, **pag nag-iisa siya, mas mabilis siyang matumba sa bagyo.** Pero yung forest? Yung group of trees? **Magkakasama yung roots nila underground.** They’re connected. They support each other. They hold each other up. And that’s why forests survive storms that individual trees can’t.

**Ganyan tayo.** We’re not just standing next to each other—we’re rooted together. And with Christ as our foundation, **we’re immovable.**”

*(Let that image stay with them.)*

-----

### **4) APPLICATION** (Make it actionable and specific)

**“So guys, hindi pwedeng puro salita lang ‘to, di ba? We need to actually LIVE this out. So here’s what I’m challenging us to do this semester.”**

-----

#### **A. Let’s commit to checking in on each other—REALLY checking in.**

“Not just ‘kamusta,’ pero yung **‘kamusta ka talaga?’** Yung tipong kapag may nakikita kang quiet sa GC, or yung parang laging absent, or yung parang di na same yung vibe, **reach out. Ask. Check.** Wag tayong mag-assume na okay lang sila. Sometimes the people who are struggling the most are the ones who are best at pretending they’re fine.

So this sem, let’s be intentional. **Let’s normalize asking ‘How’s your heart?’ hindi lang ‘How’s your acads?’**”

-----

#### **B. Let’s pray for each other—actively and consistently.**

“Guys, prayer is our weapon. Pero minsan nakakalimutan natin gamitin. So let’s make it a habit. Kahit random sa GC. Kahit ‘bro, pray for me, exam bukas.’ Kahit ‘guys, pray for my family.’ Kahit ‘pray for my faith, parang dry ako lately.’

**Let’s pray FOR each other, and let’s pray WITH each other.** And guys, yung prayers natin don’t have to be poetic or perfect. **Simple prayers, sincere hearts—yan yung naririnig ni Lord.**”

-----

#### **C. Let’s keep Christ at the center—always.**

“This is the most important. Kasi yung friendship natin, yung bond natin, **it’s only as strong as our connection to Christ.** Pag nawawala si Jesus sa picture, we’re just two strands. Pero pag nandyan Siya, we’re unbreakable.

So let’s be intentional about pointing each other back to Him. **Whether it’s through sharing a verse sa GC, inviting each other to church, reminding each other to read the Word, or just saying ‘bro, let’s pray’ when things get tough.**

**Let’s make sure that in this season, we’re not just growing academically—we’re growing spiritually. Together.**”

-----

#### **D. Let’s have fun and rest well.**

“And guys, one more thing: **let’s not forget to have fun.** Yeah, acads is hard. Yeah, life is serious. Pero we’re also allowed to enjoy this season. **Tara gala. Tara kain. Tara tambay.** Those moments matter. Kasi those are the moments kung saan nabubuo yung friendship, yung bond, yung memories.

And also—**let’s rest well.** Burnout is real. Mental health is real. Spiritual exhaustion is real. So let’s remind each other na okay lang mag-pause. Okay lang mag-rest. **Hindi tayo machines. We’re human beings, and part of honoring God is taking care of the body and mind He gave us.**”

-----

### **5) CLOSING PRAYER** (Heartfelt and personal)

**“Alright guys, let’s close this in prayer. And habang nag-ppray ako, feel free to pray along in your hearts. Sabay-sabay tayo dito.”**

-----

*“Lord Jesus, thank You. Thank You for this moment. Thank You for bringing us together—not by coincidence, but by Your perfect design. Thank You for this group, for these brothers na kasama ko ngayong season.*

*Lord, we know the road ahead won’t be easy. The subjects are tough. The pressure is real. There will be moments when we’ll feel like giving up, moments when we’ll doubt ourselves, moments when we’ll feel alone even when we’re surrounded by people.*

*But Lord, we’re claiming Your promise today—that two people are better off than one, and a triple-braided cord is not easily broken. Remind us that we’re not walking this path alone. **Remind us that we have each other, and that we have You.***

*Help us to be there for each other, Lord. Teach us to listen more, to care more, to check in more. Help us to lift each other up when we fall, to encourage each other when we’re tired, to pray for each other when we’re weak. **Strengthen our friendship, deepen our faith, and keep You at the center of everything we do.***

*We surrender this semester to You—our grades, our fears, our dreams, our struggles, our relationships, our future. Guide us every step of the way. Give us wisdom when we’re confused. Give us strength when we’re weak. Give us peace when we’re anxious. **And remind us daily that You are with us, that You are for us, and that You will never leave us nor forsake us.***

*Lord, bless each one of us here. Protect our minds, our hearts, our spirits. Help us to honor You in all that we do—in our studies, in our friendships, in our choices. **Use this season to shape us, to mold us, to grow us into the men You’ve called us to be.***

*We trust You, Lord. We believe in Your goodness. We rest in Your faithfulness. **This semester is Yours. Our lives are Yours. Use us for Your glory.***

*In Jesus’ mighty name, Amen.”*

-----

### **BONUS CLOSING LINE / WRAP-UP:**

*(After the prayer, lighten the mood slightly but keep it sincere.)*

**“Alright guys. Let’s do this sem TOGETHER. Hindi tayo mag-iisa. We got each other. We got Christ. Kaya natin ‘to. Let’s make this semester one for the books—not just dahil sa grades, but dahil sa kung paano tayo nag-grow together, nag-support sa isa’t isa, and nag-honor kay Lord.

Tara na, kain na tayo! Samahan natin ng good food yung good vibes!” 😄**

-----

### **POST-DISCUSSION IDEAS (optional but helpful):**

If you want to extend the moment and make it more memorable:

- Take a group photo with the nature background
- Create a small covenant together (like a group chat name change or a verse to claim for the sem)
- Maybe end with a group hug or fist bump—something symbolic
