## 🎭 Tone & Style Guide

### Overall Vibe: **Sarcastic & Self-Deprecating**

```
❌ DON'T: "Download our amazing app that will change your life!"
✅ DO: "We literally had to threaten each other with money to stop doom-scrolling. It's working. Unfortunately."
```

### Humor Formula

1. **Setup** - Relatable problem (doom-scrolling, broken promises)
2. **Escalation** - Make it absurd (₱100 ransom, group chat chaos)
3. **Punchline** - Self-aware sarcasm ("we're still broke but at least we're improving")

### Voice Characteristics

- **Ellariecia's Narration Style:**
  - Deadpan delivery
  - Pauses before punchlines
  - Eye contact with camera during sarcastic moments
  - Occasional breaking of fourth wall

### Recommended Settings (BulSU Vibes)

| Scene Type       | Location Ideas           | Props Needed                          |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| "The Problem"    | Dorm room, messy desk    | Phone showing TikTok, energy drinks   |
| "Friend Group"   | Campus canteen, tambayan | Laptops, notebooks, snacks            |
| "The Solution"   | Clean study area         | Phone with Kleeve open, good lighting |
| "Ransom Drama"   | Anywhere dramatic        | Fake GCash screenshots, ₱100 bills    |
| "Success Moment" | Library, coffee shop     | Group celebration shots               |

### Lighting Tips

- **Natural light** from windows (golden hour = chef's kiss)
- **Ring light** for close-up narration
