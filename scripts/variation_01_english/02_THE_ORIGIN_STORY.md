## 🎬 SCRIPT: "How 7 Broke Students Built an App Because We Couldn't Stop Scrolling"

### SCENE 1: The Hook (0:00 - 0:03)

```
[VISUAL: Ellariecia lying in bed, phone above face, dark room lit only by phone glow]
[SOUND: TikTok scroll sounds]

ELLARIECIA (V.O.):
"It's 3 AM. I have a quiz at 7. I'm watching a tutorial on how to make friendship bracelets."

[Beat]

"I don't even have friends."

[Cut to black - record scratch]
```

**EDIT NOTES:**

- Blue phone light effect on face
- Text overlay: "3:47 AM"
- Record scratch sound at joke
- Quick black frame transition

---

### SCENE 2: The Problem Montage (0:04 - 0:12)

```
[VISUAL: Quick cuts of each friend in their "problem state"]

ELLARIECIA (V.O.):
"So there were 7 of us. All CS students. All addicted to our phones."

[Cut: Kenny at desk, phone hidden under book, clearly scrolling]
TEXT: "Kenny - 'studying'"

[Cut: Lorenz dramatically lying on floor]
TEXT: "Lorenz - existential crisis #47"

[Cut: Rodelyn crocheting but phone propped up with TikTok playing]
TEXT: "Rodelyn - 'multitasking'"

[Cut: Eliesha writing poetry but actually typing tweets]
TEXT: "Eliesha - 'finding inspiration'"

[Cut: Alex with sketchbook open but scrolling instead]
TEXT: "Alex - 'looking for drawing references' (for 45 minutes)"

[Cut: Ica with color-coded planner but watching reels]
TEXT: "Ica - 'planning her productive day'"

[Cut: Ellariecia on bed]
TEXT: "Me - not even pretending anymore"
```

**EDIT NOTES:**

- Each cut is 1-1.5 seconds
- Names pop up with funny subtitles
- Use same filter across all for cohesion
- Slightly sad/comedic background music

---

### SCENE 3: The Turning Point (0:13 - 0:22)

```
[VISUAL: Group chat recreation on screen]

ELLARIECIA (V.O.):
"One day, Kenny said something in our group chat that changed everything."

[SHOW TEXT MESSAGES:]
Kenny: "guys i just checked my screen time"
Kenny: "i spent 9 hours on tiktok yesterday"
Kenny: "NINE."
Lorenz: "bro i have 11 💀"
Ica: "we need help"
Ellariecia: "what if we pay each other when we fail"
Alex: "???"
Ellariecia: "like. real money. ₱100."
Rodelyn: "that's evil"
Eliesha: "i'm in"

[Cut to group video call - everyone looking serious]

ELLARIECIA (V.O.):
"And just like that, we declared war on ourselves."
```

**EDIT NOTES:**

- iPhone message sounds
- Screen recording style animation
- Dramatic zoom on "₱100"
- Military drum sound at "declared war"

---

### SCENE 4: The Solution (0:23 - 0:35)

```
[VISUAL: Kenny coding on laptop, others looking over shoulder]

ELLARIECIA (V.O.):
"Kenny's a developer. We gave him no choice."

[Cut: Whiteboard with app sketches]

KENNY (speaking to camera, exhausted):
"They said 'make us an app or pay everyone's ransom.'
I coded for 72 hours straight."

[Cut: App screens scrolling]

ELLARIECIA (V.O.):
"We built Kleeve. It's simple:
- Pick a habit you want to build.
- Your friends can see if you actually do it.
- Skip a day? You pay ₱100 to the group fund.
- And there's a timer so you can't cheat."

[Cut: Screen recording of the actual Kleeve app]

"It's basically group peer pressure... but make it an app."
```

**EDIT NOTES:**

- Typing sounds during coding scene
- App UI showcase with smooth transitions
- Highlight each feature with text overlay
- Upbeat music transition

---

### SCENE 5: The Results (0:36 - 0:48)

```
[VISUAL: Calendar showing streak]

ELLARIECIA (V.O.):
"It's been 47 days."

[Quick montage - HAPPY VERSIONS of earlier scenes:]

[Kenny actually studying, no phone]
TEXT: "Kenny - actually passed his quiz"

[Lorenz smiling, doing his habit]
TEXT: "Lorenz - only 2 existential crises this week"

[Rodelyn crocheting peacefully, phone away]
TEXT: "Rodelyn - made 3 scarves"

[Eliesha writing in notebook]
TEXT: "Eliesha - wrote 12 poems (real ones)"

[Alex actually drawing in sketchbook]
TEXT: "Alex - filled 3 sketchbook pages"

[Ica checking off planner items]
TEXT: "Ica - became the person she planned to be"

[Ellariecia at desk, productive]
TEXT: "Me - somehow has a life now?"

ELLARIECIA (V.O.):
"Did we cure our addiction? No.
But we're improving. And that's something."
```

**EDIT NOTES:**

- Brighter color grading for "after" shots
- Triumphant music
- Before/after split if time allows
- Streak counter animation

---

### SCENE 6: The Honest Ending (0:49 - 0:55)

```
[VISUAL: All 7 friends sitting together, casual hangout]

ELLARIECIA (to camera):
"Look, we're still broke college students who built this with zero budget."

[Others nodding in background]

"But if you're tired of lying to yourself too...
We're opening signups soon."

[Holds up phone showing app]

"Link in bio. Join the waitlist.
Or don't. Keep doomscrolling.
Your ₱100. Your choice."

[Winks at camera]

ALL 7 (chaotic, overlapping):
"DOWNLOAD KLEEVE!"

[End card with logo and "Link in Bio"]
```

**EDIT NOTES:**

- Warm, natural lighting
- Genuine laughs encouraged
- End card: Logo + "Join the Waitlist" + link placeholder
- Blooper-ish vibe for group yell

## 💡 PRO TIPS

1. **Film "before" and "after" in same session** - just change lighting and energy
2. **Get genuine reactions** - tell jokes off-camera
3. **Multiple takes of CTA** - pick the most natural one
4. **Film horizontal backup** - for YouTube if needed
5. **Capture bloopers** - use for separate video
