## 🎬 SCRIPT A: "Kenny's First Ransom Payment"

### SCENE 1: The Crime (0:00 - 0:08)

```
[VISUAL: Kenny on his phone, clearly scrolling TikTok at 11:45 PM]
[SOUND: Clock ticking ominously]

TEXT ON SCREEN: "11:45 PM - 15 minutes before deadline"

ELLARIECIA (V.O., documentary style):
"The suspect was last seen at 11:45 PM.
He had one job: complete his 5-minute habit.
He chose violence."

[Cut to Kenny's POV - TikTok "just one more video" autoplay]

[SOUND: Notification ding]

TEXT: "Kleeve: ⚠️ You haven't completed your habit today"

[Kenny looks at notification, swipes it away, keeps scrolling]
```

**EDIT NOTES:**

- Crime documentary filter (slightly desaturated)
- Red flashing on the notification
- Dramatic zoom on swipe-away action
- Suspense music

---

### SCENE 2: The Discovery (0:09 - 0:18)

```
[VISUAL: Clock striking midnight with dramatic effect]
[SOUND: Gong/bell sound]

TEXT: "12:00 AM - THE DEADLINE"

[Cut to: Group chat notifications EXPLODING]

[Screen recording style:]
KLEEVE BOT: "🚨 Kenny has FAILED to complete his habit!"
KLEEVE BOT: "Ransom owed: ₱100"

[Cut to: Each friend's reaction - filmed separately, edited together]

LORENZ: *gasps dramatically, hand on chest*

ALEX: *stops mid-workout, shocked pikachu face*

RODELYN: *slowly looks up from crochet, disappointed parent energy*

ICA: *checking phone, shaking head*

ELIESHA: *poetic sadness* "How could you..."

ELLARIECIA: *evil smile* "Pay up."
```

**EDIT NOTES:**

- Each reaction is 1-2 seconds max
- Use dramatic sound effect per reaction
- Split screen possible for maximum chaos
- Text overlays with their names

---

### SCENE 3: The Confrontation (0:19 - 0:32)

```
[VISUAL: Group video call or in-person meetup - feels like an intervention]
[SOUND: Serious music, court drama vibes]

ELLARIECIA:
"Kenny. You stand accused of:
- Watching TikToks about 'sigma male edits' until midnight
- Ignoring 3 app notifications
- And breaking our 15-day streak."

KENNY: *head down in shame*
"I just wanted to see one more video..."

LORENZ: *standing up dramatically*
"ONE MORE VIDEO?! We had FIFTEEN DAYS, KENNY. FIFTEEN!"

[Cut to: Fake "evidence" slideshow]
TEXT: "Exhibit A: Kenny's Screen Time - 8 hours TikTok"
TEXT: "Exhibit B: The notification he ignored"
TEXT: "Exhibit C: The audacity"

ALEX:
"Bro. I woke up at 5 AM for the gym. For the STREAK."

ICA: *holding calculator*
"That's ₱100 to the group fund. Cash or GCash?"

KENNY: *pulls out wallet sadly*
"GCash..."
```

**EDIT NOTES:**

- Law & Order style title cards
- Evidence slideshow with dramatic transitions
- Calculator sound effect when Ica speaks
- Sad piano when Kenny agrees to pay

---

### SCENE 4: The Payment (0:33 - 0:42)

```
[VISUAL: Close-up of phone - GCash/payment app]
[SOUND: Cash register "cha-ching"]

[Show fake GCash screenshot:]
"You sent ₱100 to KLEEVE GROUP FUND"
"Message: 'I have failed you all'"

[Cut to: Group celebrating while Kenny cries in background]

RODELYN: *counting money gesture*
"Pizza fund is growing~"

ELIESHA: *patting Kenny's shoulder*
"Your sacrifice will be remembered."

ELLARIECIA (to camera):
"Day 16. Kenny learned his lesson.
The streak continues.
The fund grows.
This is Kleeve."

[End card with logo]
```

**EDIT NOTES:**

- Fake but realistic-looking GCash screenshot
- Money rain effect optional
- Celebration vs. Kenny's sadness split screen
- Triumphant music

---

### SCENE 5: The Outro/CTA (0:43 - 0:47)

```
[VISUAL: All 7 together, Kenny still fake-crying]

KENNY (to camera):
"Don't be like me. Actually do your habits."

ELLARIECIA:
"Or do be like him. We need pizza money."

ALL: "Link in bio!"

[End card: KLEEVE logo + "Join the Waitlist"]
```

"Anyone else... hoping Kenny fails again?"

[Everyone slowly nodding]

ALEX:
"That ₱100 bought us a whole pizza last week."

ICA: *checking app obsessively*
"He only has 2 hours left to complete his habit..."

RODELYN:
"Should we... distract him?"

[Cut to: Them sending Kenny memes]

[Cut to: Kenny fighting temptation, looking at phone]

KENNY (to camera, sweating):
"My friends have become my enemies."

[Text on screen: "He survived. Barely."]

[End card]
```

"FIVE MINUTES?!"

[Starts his habit timer frantically]

[Cut to: Group chat going crazy]

"GO GO GO"
"YOU CAN DO IT"
"IF YOU FAIL I STG"

[Cut to: Timer counting down]
4:59... 4:58... 4:57...

KENNY: *actually focusing for once*

[Montage: Study flashcards flying, intense focus]

[Timer hits 0:00]

[Cut to: Group chat celebration]

"LETS GOOOO"
"STREAK SAVED"
"no pizza for us today 😭" - Lorenz

ELLARIECIA (V.O.):
"Another day. Another ₱100 saved.
That's Kleeve."
```

## 🎭 CHARACTER DIRECTION

### Kenny (The Victim)

- Play up the "caught in 4K" energy
- Physical comedy welcome (dramatic falls, exaggerated sadness)
- Should look genuinely defeated when paying

### Lorenz (The Drama)

- Telenovela-level overacting
- Hand gestures, gasps, dramatic pauses
- Can play either victim or villain depending on script

### Ellariecia (The Narrator)

- Deadpan delivery contrasting with chaos
- Fourth-wall breaks
- Slight smile when delivering savage lines

### Others (The Jury)

- Synchronized disappointed looks
- Background reactions (nodding, gasping)
- Can have individual moments of personality

## 💡 COMEDY TIPS

1. **Commit to the bit** - The more serious the delivery, the funnier
2. **Let Kenny suffer** - His pain is content
3. **Reactions > Words** - Facial expressions carry comedy
4. **Timing matters** - Pause before punchlines
5. **Improv welcome** - Best moments are often unscripted

---

## 🔄 SERIES POTENTIAL

This can become a recurring series:

- "Week 1: Kenny pays ransom"
- "Week 2: Lorenz's turn 💀"
- "Week 3: The entire group almost fails"
- "Week 4: Someone actually loses ₱500"

Track real ransom payments for authentic content!

_Remember: The funnier Kenny looks, the more engagement you'll get. Sorry Kenny._
