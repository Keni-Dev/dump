## 🎬 SCRIPT A: "The 3AM Spiral"

### The Full Script (40 seconds)

```
[VISUAL: Dark room, phone lighting face, clearly 3AM energy]
[SOUND: Lo-fi or silence, very quiet vibe]

ELLARIECIA (whispering to camera):
"It's 3 AM.
I have a 7 AM class.
I am watching a video essay about why Shrek is a cinematic masterpiece."

[Beat - dead stare]

"This is the 47th video.
The first one was about cooking.
I don't even cook."

[Cut to: Screen showing spiral of random TikToks]
- "How to fold a fitted sheet"
- "Rating every McDonald's menu item"
- "Cats that act like humans compilation"
- "Dark history of Teletubbies"

ELLARIECIA (V.O.):
"The algorithm has me in a chokehold.
My brain says stop.
My thumb says 'one more.'
This has been happening for 3 years."

[Cut back to face, slightly more lit]

"That's why I needed my friends to literally threaten me with money."

[Shows phone with Kleeve]

"Now if I doom-scroll past midnight without doing my habit...
I owe ₱100.
To people who will NOT let me forget."

[Quick cut to: Group chat roasting someone]

"Is it healthy? Probably not.
Is it working? Unfortunately, yes."

[Lies back down]

"Anyway, it's 3 AM.
But I already did my 5 minutes today.
So this one's just for fun."

[Winks, keeps scrolling]

[End card: "Link in bio - for when you're ready to stop lying to yourself"]
```

**EDIT NOTES:**

- Very dark room, phone glow only
- Whisper ASMR vibes
- Text overlays for the random video topics
- Quick cuts during the spiral description
- Warmer lighting when showing Kleeve

## 🎬 SCRIPT B: "ML at 2AM vs. Studying" (Gaming Version)

> For the Mobile Legends addicts in the audience

### Full Script (35 seconds)

```
[VISUAL: Phone showing ML loading screen]
[SOUND: ML lobby music quietly]

ALEX (to camera, dead inside):
"I told myself 'one game.'
That was 6 games ago.
It's now 2 AM.
I have a lab report due at 8."

[Cut to: Match history showing losses]

"I'm not even winning."

[Shows screen time: ML - 4 hours]

"At this point I'm not playing for fun.
I'm playing because I forgot how to stop."

[Dramatic pause]

"You know what finally worked?"

[Shows Kleeve notification: "Complete your habit before midnight!"]

"Knowing that if I don't study for at least 5 minutes...
Six people will see my failure.
And I'll owe them money."

[Cut to: Actually opening study materials]

"My MMR is still trash.
But at least I'm passing my classes."

[End card]

ALEX (V.O.):
"Kleeve. For when your willpower is weaker than your Legend rank."
```

**EDIT NOTES:**

- Blur/avoid showing actual ML branding if needed
- Show relatable gaming stats (losing streak)
- Quick transition to productive mode
- Gaming → studying visual contrast

KENNY:
"I once watched a 3-hour video about the history of bread.
I don't even like bread that much."

[Cut to Lorenz]
LORENZ:
"I told everyone I was 'researching for a project.'
I was watching celebrity drama for 4 hours."

[Cut to Rodelyn]
RODELYN:
"I scroll TikTok while crocheting.
That's why my scarves have holes.
I'm not even looking at my hands."

[Cut to Eliesha]
ELIESHA:
"I was supposed to write poetry.
I read Twitter drama threads until 4 AM instead.
The drama was poetic, at least."

[Cut to Alex]
ALEX:
"I skip gym because I'm 'tired.'
But I have energy to play ML until 3 AM?
Make it make sense."

[Cut to Ica]
ICA:
"I have 47 productivity apps.
My screen time is still 7 hours.
I am the problem."

[Cut to Ellariecia]
ELLARIECIA:
"I am literally building an app to fix this.
And I still doomscrolled for 2 hours yesterday.
We're all hopeless."

[ALL - overlapping chaotic energy:]
"That's why we made Kleeve!"
"At least we suffer together!"
"Link in bio!"

[End card with genuine tired laughs]
```

**EDIT NOTES:**

- Each confession is 5-6 seconds
- Same filter/color grade for cohesion
- Name tags for each person
- End with chaotic group energy

## 🌙 FILMING TIPS FOR 3AM CONTENT

### Lighting Setup

```
❌ Don't: Film in complete darkness (hard to see)
✅ Do: Phone light + small lamp behind camera

Ideal setup:
- Ring light on lowest setting
- Fairy lights in background
- "Phone glow" effect for authenticity
```

### Audio Tips

```
- Whisper or soft voice (3AM energy)
- Quiet lo-fi background optional
- Room tone (slight ambient noise is okay)
- NO loud music (breaks the vibe)
```

### Outfit/Appearance

```
- Messy hair is authentic
- Oversized shirt/hoodie
- Eye bags are a feature, not a bug
- No makeup unless it's "clearly been on all day"
```

### Props

```
- Phone (obviously)
- Empty snack wrappers
- Energy drink cans
- Books you're supposed to be reading
- Laptop with 47 tabs open
```
