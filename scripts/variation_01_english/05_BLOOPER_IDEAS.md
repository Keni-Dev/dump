## 🎭 BLOOPER CATEGORY 1: Line Failures

### The Classic Stumble

```
[Ellariecia trying to deliver a serious line]

ELLARIECIA:
"Kleeve is the app that helps you-"
*forgets line*
"Wait, what do we do again?"

KENNY (off-camera):
"Track habits."

ELLARIECIA:
"Right. Kleeve helps you tr- STOP LAUGHING LORENZ"

[Cut to: Lorenz dying in the background]
```

---

### The Tongue Twister

```
[Alex trying to say the tagline]

ALEX:
"Accountability through friend-"
*stops*
"Accountabil- Accounta-"
"Why is that word so hard?!"

[Everyone laughing]

ALEX:
"ACCOUNTABILITY. There. I said it."
```

---

### The Improv Gone Wrong

```
[Eliesha adding her own dramatic flair]

ELIESHA:
"And on the 47th day... the streak was..."
*dramatic pause*
*longer pause*
*too long*

SOMEONE (off-camera):
"...alive?"

ELIESHA:
"I forgot the word."
```

---

## 🤣 BLOOPER CATEGORY 2: Breaking Character

### Kenny Can't Stay Sad

```
[Kenny supposed to look devastated about paying ransom]

DIRECTOR:
"Okay Kenny, look really sad."

KENNY:
*tries to look sad*
*starts smiling*
"I can't, this is too funny"

[Multiple takes of Kenny failing to look sad]

FINAL TAKE:
[Kenny successfully sad for 2 seconds, then cracks up]
```

---

### Lorenz's Overacting

```
[Lorenz supposed to gasp dramatically]

TAKE 1:
*tiny gasp*
"Was that too small?"

TAKE 2:
*HUGE theatrical gasp, clutches chest*
*falls off chair*

EVERYONE:
[Dying of laughter]

LORENZ:
"What?! You said DRAMATIC!"
```

---

### The Uncontrollable Laugh

```
[Trying to film serious confrontation scene]

RODELYN: *supposed to look disappointed*
*looks at Kenny*
*starts laughing*

KENNY: *joins*

[Domino effect - everyone starts laughing]

[5 minutes later, still trying to film]

ELLARIECIA:
"Okay nobody look at Kenny."

[Everyone immediately looks at Kenny]
[More laughter]
```

---

## 📱 BLOOPER CATEGORY 3: Technical Failures

### The Notification Interruption

```
[Middle of emotional monologue]

ELLARIECIA:
"And that's when I realized... I needed to change my-"

*LOUD NOTIFICATION SOUND*
*Phone screen shows: "Mom: 🍔 dinner?"*

ELLARIECIA:
"...life. But first, apparently, dinner."
```

---

### The Background Chaos

```
[Ica delivering her line perfectly]

ICA:
"With Kleeve, you can track your habits and-"

[In background: Alex trips over something, loud crash]

ICA: *doesn't break*
"-and hold each other accountable."

[Cut to: Alex on the floor]

ALEX:
"I'm fine. Keep going."
```

---

### The Camera Issues

```
[Everyone positioned perfectly for group shot]

ELLARIECIA:
"On three, everyone say Kleeve!"

EVERYONE:
"KLEEVE!"

[Beat]

KENNY (checking phone):
"...I forgot to hit record."

[Collective groan]
```

---

## 🎬 BLOOPER CATEGORY 4: The Honest Moments

### Between Takes Chaos

```
[Waiting to film]

RODELYN: *crocheting*
"How long have we been here?"

LORENZ:
"Three hours."

ICA:
"We've filmed two videos."

ELIESHA:
"This is fine."

[Everyone stares into the void]

ALEX: *starts doodling on napkin*
"At least I'm getting my habit done."
```

---

### The Real Reactions

```
[Checking Kleeve app for real during filming]

KENNY:
"Wait, Lorenz actually missed his habit yesterday?!"

LORENZ:
"We weren't supposed to show that!"

ELLARIECIA:
"PAY UP!"

[Chaos ensues - this is now real content]
```

---

### The 47th Take

```
TEXT: "Take 47."

ELLARIECIA:
"I physically cannot say 'accountability' one more time."

KENNY:
"Accounta-"

ELLARIECIA:
"I WILL end you."
```

## 🎯 BLOOPER CONTENT IDEAS

### "How It Started vs. How It's Going"

```
SPLIT SCREEN:
Left: Professional filming attempt
Right: Complete chaos

Repeat for multiple scenes
```

---

### "Director's Cut" Series

```
Show the "professional" version first
Then show what it took to get there
"23 takes and 4 meltdowns later..."
```

---

### "Things We Said During Filming"

```
Text-on-screen format with audio:
- "Why is my face doing that"
- "Can we take a break I'm hungry"
- "STOP MAKING ME LAUGH"
- "That was perfect- wait it wasn't recording"
- "I forgot what app we're promoting"
```

---

### "The Blooper That Became the Final Take"

```
Show a "mistake" that was actually funnier
Than what was scripted
"We kept this one."
```

---

2. **React genuinely** - Forced laughter looks fake
3. **Include everyone** - Rotate who's the "victim"

5. **Get consent** - Make sure everyone's okay being in bloopers
